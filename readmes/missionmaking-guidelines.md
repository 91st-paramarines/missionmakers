# Missionmakers guidelines

This documents presents some general guidelines and checklists for missionmakers to follow.
These guidelines are the result of our combined missionmakers' experience, not just some fanciful requirements to look cool, so please read carefully as this can save us all lots of time and frustration.

## Missionmaking checklist

<details>

### General advice

- Check your mods are up to date
- Make sure you're using the correct modlist (ie remove whatever additional mods you may be using client-side)
- If you are making a long mission (several main objectives), do a multiplayer test every time you complete a major section, on a dedicated server if available, local host otherwise
- If you don’t have direct access to the server ask either Compton, Ollo, Wonko or Miller
- We don’t want a server test to be run at 5 PM day of, always try and get a server test done as far in advance as you practically can (two days is a good compromise)
- Have you set a particular time for your mission to start in game ?

  
### In-game

- Load in the add-on on settings
- If you wish an add-on setting to be changed, bring it up to your CO
- Under `Attributes > Settings > General > Misc`, tick `Binarise the scenario file & editable objects (zeus)`
- Under `Attributes > Settings > General > Multiplayer > Lobby`, untick `Enable AI`
- Under `Attributes > Settings > General > Multiplayer > Respawn` select `Respawn on custom position` then select `Select respawn position` then set the respawn delay to 5 seconds
