# Missionmakers resources

This is the place where we gather all sorts of useful stuff for our missionmakers

## Addon-settings

### Settings hierarchy
In multiplayer, add-on settings are three-tiered :
- client settings affect only the local machine. They are set by each connected player for their own computer.
- mission settings affect all connected players. They are set by the missionmaker, and can overwrite client settings <b>if explicitly specified</b>.
- server settings affect all connected players. They are set by the server admin, and can overwrite mission settings as well as client settings <b>if explicitly specified</b>.

### Default settings
[This file](mission.txt) contains the current mission add-on settings for missionmakers to import into their own scenarios.<br>
[This file](server.txt) contains the current server add-on settings (for reference).
