# README

This repo holds all kinds of useful stuff for missionmakers and zeuses alike.
DISCLAIMER : this is NOT a comprehensive tutorial, the purpose of this repo is to provide you with quick references, scripts, tips and tricks, not teach you missionmaking or zeusing.
Specifically, this repo was written under the assumption that you have basic programming knowledge in SQF.
General tutorials on arma scripting are thus not included here, check our useful links for that.
